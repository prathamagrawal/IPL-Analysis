The last time he averaged 30-plus in an IPL season was in 2016. Since then, Rohit has averaged below 30 - in the high twenties - every year. His strike rates in these five seasons have been ordinary too: he has struck at 130-plus only in one of them - in 2018. From the 2019 season, when he began opening for Mumbai Indians regularly, Rohit has averaged 27.9 and struck at 127.7. However, these numbers are not indicative of what he is capable of.</blockquote><br><br>M Saini: ""Loving this year's IPL...five teams at 6 points each and three teams at 4 points each, and two teams below 4 points are the ones expected to be at top of table.

His scouting tells me Tymal Mills should be back. Tim David could be back too.<br><br>Pahul Gill: ""I am very interested to see how PBKS counter Bumrah this match. He is the only wicket taking threat in this MI bowling line-up. If they are smart, they should play him out and attack the other bowlers. You don't want another Rashid Khan situation. A lot of runs to be had targeting the likes of Sams/Allen, Unadkat, Thampi, Murugan, Mills/Meredith""<br><br></p><p><strong>6.30pm</strong> Game 23 of IPL 2022. It's the winless Mumbai Indians against the exciting Punjab Kings, who have been trying their best to counter the handicap of losing the toss by batting aggressively. Both these sides have been unlucky with the toss, having won just one each in four matches each. PBKS, though, have managed to put four points on the board. MI remain the only team with no win so far.<bR><br>Mumbai Indians will be looking forward to the return of Daniel Sams, who missed the last match with a stomach bug. PBKS have the Odean Smith question to ponder: he is an exciting talent for sure, but is he good enough to be bowling four overs regularly? Of course Liam Livingstone does help out with the ball too, but Arshdeep Singh needs support at the death. Remember Delhi Capitals didn't use to use Kagiso Rabada right at the end of the innings. In half an hour we will know how the teams think about these combinations.</p>",

I thought we played the game pretty well, came pretty close towards the back end of our batting innings. It's just that a couple of crucial runouts there was not needed, but that happens. At one stage we were cruising through and keeping up with the run rate as well, but in the end we couldn't hold our nerves. Credit to Kings with the way they bowled at the back end. [On changing batting order] If you're not winning games, you've got to try to find a way you can succeed as a team as a batting group. So we're trying to find different ideas, different thought processes. It doesn't seem to be working at the moment but I don't want to take anything away from the guys. We fought pretty well. We batted brilliantly, but they held their nerves pretty good, the Kings, and they won the game. We've been not playing good cricket for awhile and that's why we've been on the losing side, simple as that. The Kings batted pretty well up front and put pressure on our bowlers, got a 90-100 run partnership to begin with. But I thought 190+ was chaseable on that pitch because that pitch was really good to bat on as you saw when we were batting as well. We just have to go back and see what we do as a team.""</p><p><b>PBKS bowler Odean Smith:</b> [About the last over] I was thinking it was such a coincidence that within four games I find myself in the same situation. What doesn't kill me makes you stronger. I just went out there and backed my best balls and it came through for us. [On coming around the wicket] Most of the guys hit the ball straight or leg side. I talked to Shikhar and he said this guy doesn't cut the ball or scoop of anything. I thought it would be harder for him to get me straight down the ground or through the leg side if I was going across him.""</p><p><b>PBKS captain Mayank Agarwal has been named Player of the Match:</b> ""It was a good night, very very happy to contribute to the team's win but the crucial thing for us was the two points. I can't really say that it was just the runs on the board. I thought this game had a lot of ups and downs, there were a lot of crucial moments and more often than not we were nailing those crucial moments and winning those crucial moments. Somehow or the other, when the game was 50/50, those moments came towards us. So it wasn't just the batting. It was those periods of the game. At the start of the tournament, we said that's the brand of cricket we want to play. We want to play aggressive, hard cricket, and with that we need to show good intent. I think this time around we were a lot smarter with the bat as well. So we showed great intent but we were a lot smarter so that we could keep wickets in hand and use the death as well. I thought in the last game against Gujarat, we gave wickets to Rashid when it wasn't required. But this time we were a lot more aware and careful. We made sure to not give wickets to their main bowlers and if it's your day, you have to take the team through. It can get hard. Credit to Brevis the way he took on Rahul and got the better of him, but then a great comeback from Rahul as well. After that one over, the other three overs he bowled were tight. Obviously when Tilak and Brevis were going the way they were going, we had to change our strategy and get into the main bowlers to try to get a wicket and luckily that happened through a runout. We don't rely on just Rabada, yes he leads the attack for us but we have two other guys to come and do that. It's nice and very happy to have three wins. I think we're playing good cricket overall and if we get 5-10% better every game, I think we'll go on to do special things.""</p><p>That's it for our IPL coverage today.

This venue has seen the most sixes so far in the comp.</p><p>Bhaskara Navulu: ""Why is the list of playing 11 not published so far. Yeah I know the teams are unchanged. But it's a bit of non-cricinfo to not publish the playing 11 after the toss"" -- Hi Bhaskara! We have a shiny new ""tab"" in the scorecard called ""Playing XI"" - do check that out! </p><p>Krishnan: ""Gill the other day reminded one of Sir IVAR. Such regal strokeplay. Including the gum chewing swagger. Hope for a repeat.""</p><p>Henri: ""Replace toss with auction. Teams would auction with runs given to opponent as currency. ""Team X chose to field and give 3 extra runs to Team Y.""""</p><p>Mustafa Moudi : ""@Henri: Do you want the losing captain to have no relief at all ?? At least they can blame the toss now but if auction happens, every one will blame the losing captain for being Over/Under Confident during the toss/auction!!""</p><p>Krish D: ""Why isnt Yash Dayal or Sai Kishore playing? Both have been outstanding in domestic cricket. Defo deserve a chance"" -- I'm sure the Titans will give them a shot at the right time. They've invested time into Abhinav Manohar and now Sai Sudharshan, so let's hope this duo gets a longish rope first.</p><p>Siddhartha Kuma: ""I don't know about you but I am tuned in to see who wins the fastest delivery money here.. I am putting my chips on ferguson"" -- Probably the best battle of the competition with Umran on the other side.</p><p>Sumit Gnawali: ""During auction teams didn't bid for legspinner that much but imp of leg spinner has increased in last few games or Am i wrong ?"" -- Indian legspinners/wristspinners are in very high demand. But spin bowlers appear quite late in the auction, batters and allrounders appear before them, so that's why they probably get fewer bidding wars. </p><p><b>Here's a revealing Maruti Suzuki ASKcricinfo stat for you: <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/ask/cricket-qna/Which-team-has-the-worst-run-rate-in-the-powerplays-in-IPL-2022&tournament=ipl"">Which team has the worst run rate in powerplay overs at IPL 2022?</a></b></p><p><strong>7pm toss</strong> The coin goes up. <B>Sunrisers Hyderabad opt to bowl.</b><br><BR><B>Kane Williamson:</b> ""Potential dew factor can make a difference.

We need to be adaptable with the grounds. Same XI.""<BR><BR><B>Hardik Pandya:</b> ""We would've bowled as well. Playing here for the first time so doesn't matter, batting first is okay. (Success as captain) Always good to win but for us results are important but processes are more important. We have got the results since we have been following the plans. This game is more important for us, we need to show we are putting in the hard work. (Tewatia as a finisher) The way he is batting, the confidence he says, it shows courage and character. Being confident is helping him. Same XI.""</p><p>Shashank: ""Kane 4/4 in tosses. Please pass on some luck to my fantasy team !!""</p><p><strong>6.58pm</strong> Just two minutes till the toss. The team winning the toss has chased in all 20 games so far!<BR><BR>In other news, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be without Harshal Patel tomorrow. Harshal lost a family member yesterday.

He takes time to settle more often that not and opening gives him the opportunity to do that. At the same time he's better equipped and experienced to tackle the new ball danger giving space for batters coming in later to play freely. Even while chasing it doesn't matter if he plays slowly as long as he stays till the point where his dismissal doesn't cause a collapse nor hurts the Chase.""</p><p>Samrat Ahuja: ""Would/Should GT persist with Wade? or go with Gurbaz . being from subcontinent, he would be better prepared to play on these pitches!"" -- It is a punt worth taking for sure! But in a winning combination, it is hard to see Wade miss out.</p><p><strong>6.41pm</strong> For the Titans, it has been quite a ride so far. At the start of the season, they were considered ""weaker"" given that their didn't appear to be any synergy in their squad and XI. But after three games, all those doubts have been put to rest, with Shami-Ferguson-Rashid being the key bowling enforcers, and Gill-Hardik-Tewatia-Miller doing enough between them to lead the batting attack. They have the pace and the spin to trouble Sunrisers today too - they have been susceptible against extra pace. And despite Gujarat's excellent run, there is still some room for improvement. Here's <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/video/ipl-2022-gt-vs-srh-do-gujarat-titans-need-another-bowling-option-1310335"">Sanjay Manrejkar and Wasim Jaffer</a> talking about today's contest.</p><p>KB: ""Should we put an end to the debate of where Williamson should play? "" -- I thought he would play at No. 4 and push Tripathi/Markram up to open in the last game, but since that didn't happen, I don't see it happening after a win. </p><p><strong>6.33pm</strong> Hello!

I try to improve every single day that I train and play. We have some amazing coaches that sit with us and have some amazing conversations.

The guys are nice and clear on their roles. Naturally there are always a number of challenges playing the best in the world and you're always under pressure but they adjusted nicely. It was quite tough to hit through the line. It was a fair game of cricket and if you could pick up wickets you could squeeze them a little bit. I think [Tripathi] might just be cramp. Hopefully it is minor and he can recover quickly. I'm not quite sure about Washington Sundar but hopefully he recovers quickly.

The tall 25-year old has T20 bowling economy of 8.20 and can bowl a mean yorker according to a quick check of his bowling on YouTube.

<p>That's all from us at ESPNcricinfo. A cracking game. A cracking defense of a par score. An impressive evening out for Hetmyer, Boult, Ashwin, de Kock, Chahal, Stoinis and Kuldeep Sen. See you tomorrow for more IPL action!</p><p>Presentation time.<B>Yuzvendra Chahal is the Player of the Match:</b> ""I've been bowling well always, in the middle I had a bad patch, but my main strength is my mind and I didn't want to divert from that. (Wet ball) It was tough but it is my duty. I am ready to bowl any time. I thought to protect runs so that it will be useful later. My favourite wicket was de Kock's dismissal since he set and is a gamechanger. (Tossing it up, Badoni wicket) He had done it before, so I thought may be he will do it again. It was my intuition, which is why I went full and wide. (150 IPL wickets) Thank you, don't think too much. Next game comes up soon. No Instagram reels for me, my Mrs is making them now (laughs).""<BR><BR><B>Winning captain Sanju Samson</b>: ""Didn't know we are top of table. (Kuldeep) Depends upon how he bowled his first three overs. I thought he had done really well and had the confidence to bowl those wide yorkers. Whatever I saw in Syed Mushtaq Ali, after that Royals picked him up. He is a special talent, can be for India soon. (Boult) Great character on and off the field. After the first ball he said, 'I will change my plans.' Really funny guy to hang around with and skills are commendable. (Hetmyer) Conversations are 'have you eaten? Slept well? Are you happy?' He has great cricketing sense and reads situations well. (Ashwin retired out) We thought if some situation occurs (before the season) that if we need to use retired out, we will. It was a team decision. (Chahal) He is someone who can be given the ball from over 1 or over 20. He is the greatest legspinner India has ever seen at present. He is a great matchwinner, Ashwin's four overs are also crucial so though why not use him later in the innings.""</p><p>Saurabh Mantri: ""Finally, first successful target defend at Wankhede this season. RR is keep on defending their target where others are struggling.""</p><p><B>Trent Boult:</b> ""(Around the wicket to KL Rahul) It was a late call in the morning. It was Neesham's idea. Rahul is a great player, but nice for a plan like that to come off. It is my role with the new ball to be aggressive and take wickets in the powerplay so it was a good feeling to get a couple. (Came over the wicket later) You guys have seen me bowl enough. At the top it is to pitch it up and get some movement. (Kuldeep Sen) He is a great guy, bowls with heart. Executed under pressure and will only grow from an experience like that. There are some quality fast bowling assets in our side and throughout the tournament. (Are you going to watch the over again?) I will probably watch my batting first.""</p><p>8670Ronnie: ""That brilliant retired out moves proves to be the masterstroke in the end ! If Ashwin had stayed, perhaps he wouldn't have been able to hit that six that Parag did and Lucknow wins the game by 2 wickets !"" -- Don't forget the four overthrows!</p><p><B>11.38pm</b> Thanks, Himanshu. Quite the hold from Kuldeep Sen at the end. </p><p>Here's losing captain <B>KL Rahul:</b> "" (His wicket) I didn't see it, otherwise would've put bat on it. Was a good ball, got to give it to Boult. (Target) We have a team that is never out of the contest. We bat really deep, got options with the ball, so we kept believing even at 20 for 3. In our games, we've gotten ourselves in some trouble and also found ways to get out of it. We needed one good partnership that didn't get going. Towards the end, brilliant from Stoinis to take it that far and give us a chance to win. (Stoinis) We know how dangerous he is, so we wanted him after the 15th over. But we have options and we will try to be unpredictable and shuffle the batting order sometimes. We sent Gowtham today since it was a 160 game, 160 games can be tricky. We know how important powerplay is, so we thought Gowtham could put bowlers off. Didn't work out today. (Summary) We've done really well so far. Our death bowling has stood out. Today we couldn't execute our yorkers well but that can happen. With Shimron and Stoinis and other guys, they can really do damage at the back end if you miss your plans. We learn from it when they don't come off.""</p><p>Sreshth will close out the day from here.</p><p><strong>11.37pm</strong> Super Giants fall short by a whisker. Maybe they got it wrong with their batting order; but maybe we wouldn't be saying that had Stoinis - even from as low as No. 8 - helped them over the line.</p>"

It is important to take a pause and think about the bowling. This is a good wicket and the batters do well. Since some of the side boundaries are longer plus the ball was gripping, it was important to do well. Shreyas was batting well and hitting it well, so that was a big wicket. Enjoyed Shreyas' wicket more because it was my first and was the main wicket from the team's point of view since he was batting well. I haven't tried too much and am focusing on my rhythm. That's what I did when I returned to the Indian team. I am enjoying my bowling and bowling good lengths. I pulled the lengths against Shreyas as well as Cummins. I am enjoying the environment here and have a good backing of the side. Rishabh guides me well from behind the stumps, too.""</p><p><b>Rishabh Pant</b>: ""We would have fielded first but didn't think much. As a batting unit we wanted to put pressure on the opposition.

Kuldeep has been working for one year but hasn't been getting enough chances. We are trying to back him and he is doing well. We wanted to keep momentum going, and hence sent Axar.

<p><b>7:07pm</b> Tripathi added his own little touch after walking in at three, looking as fluent as ever in his 15-ball 39. Earlier the SRH bowlers, led by Washington Sundar's two for 21 ensured that CSK don't run away with the game. T Natarajan, Aiden Markram et al struck at regular intervals to then restrict CSK to a gettable total.</p><p>kumar: ""Rahul tripathi is an under-rated cricketer. He has consistently played valuable knocks since all through last few seasons, yet he is seldom given much attention or credit in discussions.""</p><p><b>Rahul Tripathi</b>: The skipper and opener gave us a great start. It was important to spend time in the middle and I had to just play my shots. It was important for the team to go out there and express ourselves. The win was very important for us. I think Abhishek played extremely well. He took the bowling on and kept up with the run-rate. The win is important because this tournament is competitive.</p><p>Here's <b>Ravindra Jadeja</b>: It's with the ball that we are disappointed but we were 20-25 runs short. We were looking to fight till the end. 155 isn't bad and our bowlers were looking to take wickets. Tomorrow might be a day off but we'll look to improve. We'll talk about where we are lacking. We are professionals and need to work hard, stick together and come back stronger.</p><p><7:02pm> Comfortable win for Sunrisers to open their account in IPL 2022 as the Super Kings still stay winless. And credit to Abhishek Sharma for acing the run-chase. Should SRH open with Abhishek? Or should they have Rahul Tripathi instead? All these questions have been laid to rest comfortably by the youngster, stroking his IPL best score. And what an opposition to do it against than the Super Kings, who have had the upper hand over Sunrisers overall in the competition.</p><p>CSK have a lot to think about with respect to their bowling composition. They couldn't dislodge Abhishek and Kane Williamson throughout the powerplay. In fact, the partnership was broken due to an error in judgement from Williamson. But Abhishek and then Tripathi ensured that there is no twist in the ultimate fate.</p>"

<p><b>9.13pm</b> Delhi Capitals have been restricted to 149 for 3, despite Shaw's opening salvo. He rattled off nine fours and two sixes during his 34-ball 61, but the rest of the batting line-up struggled. Here's K Gowtham speaking to Star Sports: ""Feels good, making a comeback to the IPL. Feels good to bowl in partnership with Ravi. It's about mixing the pace and you can't bowl one pace. We communicated it to the bowlers. Some [balls] are holding in the surface. I think there were some jitters; I haven't played much in the last three years, so I would take that as a learning and will move forward. I'll learn from my mistakes.""

We showed a lot of character but after the powerplay, the bowlers had a good chat and knew what lines and lengths to bowl and executed well. We just like to know what to chase. Dew factor does play on the minds of team and everyone chooses to bowl first because of that. Last game there wasn't much dew here and we got lucky.

<p><b>11.50pm:</b> That's a wrap for another day at the IPL. <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2022-1298423/rajasthan-royals-vs-royal-challengers-bangalore-13th-match-1304059/match-report>Sreshth Shah has rattled up the report</a> and there will be more video and analysis on the site shortly. Thanks for keeping us company, we'll do it all again tomorrow. Bye!</p><p><b>11.40pm:</b> Time for the presentations. RCB captain <b>Faf du Plessis</b>: ""That's one out of the hat. To pull it out of nowhere you need some good characters, and DK is as big a character as you can get. That calmness towards the end allows others to just come in. I think we bowled really well up until the 19th, then Jos got some shots in with the bowlers under pressure. Got them a score just above par. We didn't get the start we needed, Yuzi came in and bowled well. But the belief we have, guys can come in and win games from nowhere. [Shahbaz innings] He's a skinny guy but he hits a long way, and he's got a clear gameplan. I believe he'll play a big part with the ball, too.""</p><p><b>Dinesh Karthik</b> is Player of the Match: ""I made a conscious effort to do justice to myself. Felt I could have done better in the last few years. The way I've trained has been different. I was telling myself I'm not done yet. I have a goal and I want to achieve something. We needed 12 runs an over, so you need to figure out what to do. Stay calm, know your game and who you can take on. Made an effort to play white-ball cricket, practice matches and scenarios. Those are the hours you put in when no one sees. The real work is done in the lead-up, which is what I'll give credit to. You have to premeditate in T20, but if it's not there, you have to have the ability to change the shot.""</p><p><b>11.27pm:</b> So DK drives Royal Challengers across the line, with solid support from Shahbaz Ahmed, handing Royals their first defeat of this year's IPL. RCB were seemingly in all sorts of strife at 88 for 5 after 13 overs, needing 82 from 42 - but Karthik took 19 off R Ashwin's fourth over, which cost 21 in all, and suddenly the momentum flipped. Sounds like the dew did properly take effect towards the end, and RR were unable to defend a middling total, underpinned by an unbeaten 70 off 47 balls from orange cap-wearer Jos Buttler</p><p>Here's Royals captain <b>Sanju Samson</b>: ""I can't pinpoint a moment [when the game was lost], great effort to put in that total, after losing the toss. Think it was a respectable score, but when the dew is coming up... I think it's a great effort by my team. As a bowling unit you like to take your time and set your fields. Lot of positives to take, and we can learn a lot of things, too.""</p>"

To be honest I didn't think about Orange Cap [he missed out by 17 runs]. Thought of a good total. Rahul and I were set, we were getting runs, and we wanted to cash in. Rahul told me it's a good wicket and to give myself time and that straight-bat shots are going to prove good. Self belief and self confidence are both high. I prepare myself as every day as a new game anyway. It's a decent total, and the balls that are delivered into the wicket are skidding a little low and not coming on well.""</p><p><b>9.15pm</b> A tightly contested innings ends with LSG setting a target of 170. Terrific innings from Hooda, 51 off 33 after coming in at 27 for 3. A half-century from Rahul as well, though at a slower pace. Good recovery from LSG, but do they have enough, especially if there's dew later on? Terrific bowling displays from the two Tamil Nadu boys in the SRH line-up too. Two early wickets from Washington Sundar, and excellent defensive bowling from T Natarajan, who finishes with 4-0-26-2.

Until next time, this is Deivarayan Muthu signing off on the behalf of Hemant Brar and Chandan Duorah. Stay safe and good night.</p><p><b>Livingstone, Player of the Match</b>: The first two games didn't go my way, but [it's] nice to contribute to a win. We got to a target we thought was defendable and the seam bowers set it up for us. We wanted to be aggressive and as exciting as we can. Nice to get a few today, but as I said the seamers set it up in the powerplay. I've been swinging hard, so nice to get it off the middle today. But it was all about the seamers. I play my own way and I struggled a bit with Rajasthan as well. Hopefully, this will bring some confidence. Bowling is something I really enjoy and I keep practicing. Hopefully, I'll come more and more into the game. I also bat in the nets with Odean Smith.</p><p><b>Agarwal</b>: We were thinking we were 5-7 short, chasing 180 is never going to be easy. I was very, very happy with the way we bowled with the new ball. I said nothing to Livingstone. Everyone holds their breath when he's batting. Vaibhav was with us a couple of years back and we saw the talent. KKR picked him up, but we wanted him because he's something different. With Jitesh, Anil <i>bhai</i> had seen him at Mumbai Indians. He has great intent and he's a fantastic keeper. The standout thing about him is his attitude. We will definitely look to play hard, positive cricket. We have to be emotionally intelligent if it doesn't come off.</p><p><b>Jadeja</b>: I think we lost too many wickets in the powerplay and didn't find momentum from ball one. We need to find a way to come back stronger. No, we need to give him [Gaikwad] confidence; we all know he's a very good player. I'm sure he will come good. Dube has been batting well and I think keeping him in a good frame of mind is the key. We will try our best to work hard and come back stronger.</p><p>The Birmingham Phoenix boys catch up at the sidelines.

They take off in the 2nd half.""</p><p><b>Dhawan</b>: It feels great. We made a great comeback. Vaibhav was swinging in the nets and troubling us - that's why he got a debut and he kept his calm. We lost early wickets and we knew we had to build a partnership. Livingstone took the game away from the opposition and I played the supporting role. We were just positive because 180 is still a big score. It's not that easy for a chasing team even though dew comes.</p><p><b>11.12pm</b> Punjab Kings hand CSK their third successive defeat. Debutant Vaibhav Arora and Kagiso Rabada scythed through the top order in the powerplay and when Odean Smith bounced out Rayudu, CSK were 36 for 5 in the eighth over. There would be no way back for them, despite a 26-ball half-century from Dube. Dhoni tuk-tuked his way to 23 off 28 balls in a bid to limit NRR damage before CSK ultimately folded for 126 in 18 overs. Kings secure their second win in three games, having stayed true to their explosive style of cricket - both with bat and ball. Agarwal will also be buoyed by the debuts of Jitesh and Arora. On the other hand, plenty to ponder already for CSK.</p><p>SpaceyAVP : ""Punjab have started to look like a dangerous side. If Rajapaksa, Smith, and Livingstone all get going (right now it seems like 1 of them does each game), it could be devastating for teams. The only thing missing seems to be a bit of experience- the tail needs to keep the momentum going. ""</p><p>Naina: ""I think it's right time to bring Bairstow in place of Rajapksa, which might be very unfortunate for him but Punjab needs a bit of experience in the lineup to not repeat what happened today where they scored only 70 runs in last 10 overs""</p><p>RayOfSunshine: ""I feel that CSK is still just a win away from clicking... Some unfortunate events - heavy dew in the second match and lack of application from almost all of batsmen have led to their downfall...""</p><p>Aravind: ""This is exactly like CSK in 2020.

Hopefully, we can defend this. </p><p><b>9.14pm</b> A 105 runs in the last ten overs but a slow start means Titans can manage only 171 for 6. Gill played an excellent knock, scoring 84 off 46.

With the calibre of bowling team-mates I have out there, it makes my job a lot easier and it was nice to pick up the treats tonight. It's great. The best thing was the fight we showed towards the end. The pressure was coming from both ends so the risks had to happen at some point. It's an instinctual thing. There was a little bit of nibble with the newer ball so I was hoping to bang away on a hard length. When Pant is there you have to be a little bit more creative, so I'm glad that one gripped. It's nice when they do. The all-round performance from the bowlers was great. Hardik is good at giving you the confidence and permission to play the game you want to play. It's nice to have a captain who trusts my abilities.""</p><p><b>Hardik Pandya:</b> ""[2 from 2?] Not bad, to be honest. Very happy with the way everyone is stepping up at the right occasion. The kind of attack we have, we thought we might be 10-15 runs short sometimes but with the attack we have, we can restrict them to 20-25 runs short. That over from Lockie changed the momentum. To be honest, I felt we were 10-15 runs short. I thought par was 185, to be honest. When Rishabh was there, I thought the game was in the balance. <b>Varun [Aaron] felt something happened to him. We were one bowler short so we had to finish the game on the 19th over.</b> Some brain has to come there... the courage Tewatia and Vijay showed, when they had not been told to bowl, they stepped up and helped us to win the game. [Gill?] Fantastic, this is the Shubman Gill we all want to see. The kind of confidence he's carrying is going to come to all the batters.""</p><p><b>Rashid Khan:</b> ""Enjoying my time so far. Had a good start, two wins in a row. So far, so good. Enjoying myself, trying my best to contribute for the team. [Mumbai vs Pune?] A bit of dew is fine, I don't mind that. It wasn't much dew there tonight. The wicket wasn't as supportive but length was crucial on this wicket. The focus was just on hitting that good area as much as possible. First over, I tried a few different grips to see which was the right one on this wicket. Overall, it was a good contribution.""</p><p><b>Rishabh Pant:</b> ""I think according to the wicket, the total was not so big. We could have batted well, especially in the middle overs. Every match, it's going to be hard for us to come back after losing so many wickets. [Ponting?] I think he's been amazing since day one. When you're on the losing side, you feel heartbroken. But we can improve in the next match.""</p><p>Mohit: ""After a whole week of chasing side dominating the match, we saw batting side winning both of today's match.

It's Umesh to start off, with one slip in place for Agarwal.  </p><p><b>Kolkata Knight Riders</b>: 1 Venkatesh Iyer, 2 Ajinkya Rahane, 3 Shreyas Iyer (capt), 4 Nitish Rana, 5 Sam Billings (wk), 6 Andre Russell, 7 Sunil Narine, 8 Tim Southee, 9 Umesh Yadav, 10 Shivam Mavi, 11 Varun Chakravarthy.</p><p><b>Punjab Kings</b>: 1 Shikhar Dhawan, 2 Mayank Agarwal (capt), 3 Bhanuka Rajapaksa (wk), 4 Liam Livingstone, 5 Raj Bawa, 6 Shahrukh Khan, 7 Odean Smith, 8 Harpreet Brar, 9 Arshdeep Singh, 10 Rahul Chahar, 11 Kagiso Rabada.</p><p><b>Maruti Suzuki ASKcricinfo stat: <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/ask/cricket-qna/Compare-the-batting-strike-rates-of-Odean-Smith-and-Andre-Russell-since-2021&tournament=allt20"">Andre Russell vs Odean Smith - who has the better strike rate</a>?</b></p><p>Meanwhile, do <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2022-1298423/kolkata-knight-riders-vs-punjab-kings-8th-match-1304054/live-match-blog"">hop over to our Live Blog</a> (briefly, before coming back here) to join Sidharth Monga as he puts this match under his microscope.</p><p>Jens: ""A lot of Sheldon Jackson bias today. As a KKR fan I don't think it is unfair to drop him - yes he contributed well behind the stumps, but little / nothing with the bat. I think Shreyas Iyer has made a brilliant decision - his captaincy has been brilliant thus far - his decisions in the last match were absolutely spot on defending a very sub-par total. Billings will be reliable behind the stumps, and has already shown his reliability and steadiness with the bat. Come on KKR!""</p><p>Pneuma: ""I don't think there is a clear stronger team this edition. This mega auction created an even page for all teams though MI and DC were the hardest hit. The squad depth may have some difference but there are strong 11s in all 10 teams. Depends on captains and coaches how they build it.""</p><p>Sarthak: ""Interesting to see who KKR drops when Cummins comes in. Think Cummins will provide them the right balance as right now they are either one batter or one bowler short. If Southee does well again they should replace Mavi with Cummins and BIllings with Jackson.""</p><p>Nikhil Sood: ""Who's keeping wickets in the PBKS?"" -- Rajapaksa.</p><p>Dev : ""Very, very harsh call to drop Sheldon. I thought he was brilliant behind the stumps. And a handy batter too."" -- Well, it was probably a forced move since Andre Russell can't bowl.</p><p>Dev: ""I'll come right out and say it: we DON'T like an IPL where the toss plays such a vital role.""</p><p><b>7.00pm</b> Shreyas Iyer tosses, Mayank Agarwal calls heads, and it's tails. <b>Kolkata Knight Riders will bowl.</b> ""The reason,"" Iyer says, ""is the swimming pool we've seen in the evening."" </p><p>Knight Riders have strengthened their bowling. Looks like Russell will probably play as a specialist batter. <strong>Shivam Mavi comes in for Sheldon Jackson</strong>. Sam Billings will probably keep wickets.</p><p>One change for PBKS as well. <b>Kagiso Rabada replaces Sandeep Sharma.</b></p><p><b>6.55pm</b> Umesh Yadav already has four powerplay wickets this season. Four more, and he'll have the all-time IPL record, as <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/ask/cricket-qna/most-wickets-in-the-powerplay&tournament=ipl"">Ask Cricinfo tells us</a>.</p><p>Nick: ""Who is Bairstow likely to replace ? Rajapaksa or Livingstone, depending on they play this match?"" -- It'll be a tough call for sure. You'd think Rajapaksa is the most vulnerable, but he offers a left-handed option in an otherwise right-hander-heavy line-up.</p><p><b>6.39pm</b> Kagiso Rabada has just received his Punjab Kings cap. Jonny Bairstow, however, is yet to complete his quarantine after flying to India from the West Indies.</p><p>Nandhana: ""KKR should try and slot in Anukul Roy - a prolific allrounder. We've seen him as a regular fielder for MI but him as a player in the 11 would be a plus point for KKR. They should also probably try to choose between Sheldon and Sam and give that spot to Anukul, or even Aman Khan so that they gain more depth in the 3 departments.""</p><p>Abhi: ""Anil Kumble and co have been receiving lot of flak the last couple of years though I feel its one of the best coaching staffs in IPL. There were many improvements. The last 2 years have been the most PBKS has been talked about in all its seasons apart from 2014. Rise of Shami as white ball bowler. Bringing out Arshdeep and Brar. Backing Mayank for a bigger role. Structured management which was absent prior. A couple of wins would have made so much difference in the points table."" -- They also happened to lose a lot of very close games both in 2021 and 2021.</p><p>Nasim: ""Any chance for Nabi in today's match?"" -- Depends on Russell's fitness and the pitch, I guess. There will be a temptation to play him, given that PBKS have two left-handers in their top three in Dhawan and Rajapaksa.</p><p>CricDude: ""KKR were a bowler short in their first two games"" -- It's always a quandary for them given how injury-prone Andre Russell is. We're waiting to see if Russell plays today, and, if not, who comes in for him.</p><p>Binu: ""I think Punjab should give chance to Rishi Dhawan for this match. He is match-winner on his day and Punjab need one gun-bowler to bowl in PP so that Arshdeep's over can be more utilised in Death.""</p><p><b>If you're in the US, you can watch the match LIVE on ESPN+ <a href=""https://www.espn.com/watch/player/_/id/11b4f39f-7cb9-458c-a962-98a1e5c98db8/country/us/redirected/true#bucketId=23396"">in English</a> and <a href=""https://www.espn.com/watch/player/_/id/f46cc5ca-e33f-43cb-b838-de8e43869b3a/country/us/redirected/true#bucketId=23396"">in Hindi</a>.</b></p><p><b>6.30pm</b> Kolkata Knight Riders have been one of the most impressive bowling teams in the early part of this season, but there are question marks over their batting. It wasn't really tested in their opening-day win over Chennai Super Kings, but in their second match, against Royal Challengers Bangalore, their approach of never taking a backward step misfired, even if their coach Brendon McCullum said he ""<a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/rcb-vs-kkr-ipl-2022-did-too-much-intent-trip-up-kkr-on-a-tacky-track-1308303"">loved the intent</a>"". He suggested that luck wasn't quite on KKR's side that day.</p><p>Their opponents today, Punjab Kings, showed what that sort of intent can do when it comes off, when they chased down 206 against RCB in their opening match. If the ball comes onto the bat nicely tonight at the Wankhede, we could have quite a game on our hands.</p><p>Hello and welcome. This is Karthik Krishnaswamy, and I have Chandan Duorah alongside me.

I didn't expect Mayank to charge down the track on the very first ball. When you're bowling at 140 clicks, your focus is to bowl the perfect line and length.""</p><p><b>Shreyas Iyer:</b> ""We were stunned - we didn't expect them to come so hard, especially losing a wicket in the first over. But when I saw them timing it so well, I thought I could as well. [Front-loading bowlers?] We got early wickets after the Powerplay so my mindset was if I get wickets as much as possible... my plan was to get the best bowlers when they had hard-hitters coming in. [Spinners?] They make my job very easy on the field. They come up with their own strategies and in team meetings, they already know their plans. They know what they're doing. [Dre?] It was such a relief to see him hit so clearly. Simply outstanding hitting - it was Russell muscle, for serious. [Umesh?] I was just having a chat with him. He said he's getting older but I told him he's getting fitter and stronger. He's been putting in the hard yards at practice, I see him in the gym every time I go.

I'm happy to do whatever the team requires. I'm looking to bowl in the death. We have a good amount of bowlers, a few guys that can slip in one or two as well. If I bowl two, at least I can feel like an allrounder. But some games, I may not bowl a ball so I'm happy to take the batting as well and hit some sixes - do whatever I can do to contribute for the team. We were a couple wickets down and behind me was Sunil and then the other bowlers. I told Sam 'listen, let's bat a few overs and see what happens'. But I realised the left-arm orthodox wasn't spinning the ball. Chahar was bowling extremely well and the ball was gripping so we didn't want to take much chance against him but I knew we'd wait on the seamers and it would get easier. [How many out of the middle?] I'm going to say one...""</p><p><b>Mayank Agarwal</b>: ""We didn't bat well enough. That's where it started. We showed some real fight with the ball initially but then Dre Russ came in and got going. Credit to him for that. It was a 170-ish wicket. I thought we started off well but couldn't capitalise, a few soft dismissals. But a game like this at the start of the tournament is fine.

That said, T20 throws some curveballs at you, got to get your chin up. (No balls from own bowlers) Its not something common to us as a side. It was a surprise. We certainly don't want to be doing that. It represents extra deliveries and when you take a wicket off it, its never nice. A number of things you can't control. (Umran Malik) Exciting, has the raw pace. He's young, got some experience last year and surely will continue to get better. We've got to side down, we've had a few days before the next game. We know the nature of T20 can be fickle. We were put under pressure in the first innings' second half, and for us as a young team we need to be nice and clear on what we want to execute.

Shami rocked them with the new ball but Hooda and Badoni led the recovery. Hooda did most of the scoring early on. Badoni took his time but once he opened, he didn't hold back. Hooda finished with 55 off 41, Badoni 54 off 41. Super Giants finish with a much respectable 158 for 6.</p>"

<p><br></p><p>That's all from our side. Hope you enjoyed our coverage. See you soon.</p><p><b>Mohammed Shami, the Player of the Match:</b> [On the first ball] I just wanted to bowl a good line and length. When the ball comes out of your hand well...people say it's a God gift but not exactly, I have worked on it a lot. Hardik had asked me if I wanted to bowl the fourth over, I said, no, keep one for later.</p><p><b>Hardik Pandya:</b> This was a right game for us to finish on either side but I am happy that we won. When wicket assists you a little bit, Shami can really come into the game. He got us to a great start. [On batting at No. 4] I want to take some more responsibility with the bat. All the players contributed. It was quite humid as well so I didn't want to take the risk of giving Shami his fourth over on the trot. Getting out to Krunal found have pinched me more if we wouldn't have won.</p><p>Varun: ""Both the newbies: Badoni and Manohar were impressive today. Was great to watch them.""</p><p><b>Rahul Tewatia:</b> The wicket was so good that Miller and I were discussing that we would take it deep and it's a matter of just one over. After I hit that six with the reverse sweep, that got Bishnoi thinking. Abhinav is a clear striker of the ball, so I had full trust in him that he would come and play his shots straightaway. It's a big thing to do it in your first game. I gave him the strike because I know he is a proper batter and can hit big shots. We are doing quality practice, not putting long hours. Ashish Nehra has kept the mood in the camp very light.</p><p><b>KL Rahul:</b> I think it was a phenomenal game. The start wasn't ideal but the way we recovered was phenomenal. We know at the Wankhede the ball can do something initially. We couldn't have started the campaign in a better way. The win would have been great but a lot to learn from this. If anyone can exploit the pitch, it's Shami. I have played with him for three-four years the last franchise and I knew he could be dangerous. I think we gave ourselves a good chance with the ball till the 14th or 15th over. But it can be difficult with the dew. We need to go back and practise a bit more with the wet ball. Credit to Tewatia and Abhinav as well. [On Ayush Badoni] He is the baby AB for us, From the first day he was batting, it was unbelievable. He can hit the ball 360 degrees. </p><p><b>11.25pm</b> Fourth time in four games the team winning the toss and opting to chase wins the match. This one, arguably, had more twists and turns. Shami bowled magnificently in the first innings before Hooda and Badoni revived Super Giants. Chasing 159, Titans were 72 for 2 in ten overs but lost Hardik and Wade in successive overs. They needed 68 from the last five overs when Hooda and Bishnoi's overs turned the complexion of the game. Tewatia and Miller started the turnaround and Manohar applied the finishing touches.</p>"

For starters, RCB are without Maxwell and Hazlewood for now but Finn Allen and Sherfane Rutherford could provide some fireworks. They'll also be relying on Mahipal Lomror and Siddarth Kaul to bring their IPL experience. Dinesh Karthik could provide the finishing touches, Faf du Plessis - the new captain - will give the opening solidity, Wanindu Hasaranga to provide the mystery... so that leaves just one question: where will Virat Kohli bat? Well, wherever he does, Ravi Shastri on ESPNcricinfo says that ""he should bat freely.""

They'll miss Jonny Bairstow's presence, though, and Kagiso Rabada's with the ball, and their biggest challenge today will be for the slightly inexperienced bowling unit to show that they have the skills to dismantle RCB's batting.

With two balls to go in the innings, Laxmi Ratan Shukla couldn't put away a yorker but Ishant strangely seemed intent to get the strike. Dhoni immediately threw the ball back to the bowler (Joginder Sharma) and Ishant had run too far. The bowler, though, didn't take the bails off immediately and waited for Ishant to start his walk to the pavilion. Once Ishant got into the striker's end, Dhoni spotted Shukla out of the crease and signalled to Joginder to take the bails off. It prompted Parthiv Patel to rush the bowler and urge him to break the stumps.

Hope you enjoyed our coverage as much as we did bringing it to you. Looking forward to your company for Sunday's double-header. Until then, this is Deivarayan Muthu signing off on the behalf of Shashank Kishore and Chandan Duorah. Stay safe and take care.</p><p>Srinivash Varma: ""Haha feels so strange to not hear MSD after the match... Felt strange MSD picking up award without hearing from him ""</p><p><b>Umesh Yadav is the Player of the Match</b>: Wickets in the powerplay is important. Team's role is what I carried out today. Usually I've been focusing on my rhythm. I'm thankful to my trainers for keeping me in shape. </p><p><b>Shreyas Iyer</b>: There's always tension when MS Dhoni is batting, especially in the last three overs when the dew is coming. The franchise has been supportive, right from the CEO and support staff. We just have to carry the momentum from here. It was definitely spongier than we imagined. I've grown up playing here and I thought the wicket would  be flat. Umesh has been working very hard at the nets and practise session. Chuffed to see him perform at his best today.</p><p><b>11.10pm</b> CSK's old boys Dhoni and Bravo sparkled, but the rest of the line-up faded away. KKR put together a near-perfect opening game. Shreyas Iyer won the toss on captaincy debut and eventually closed out the chase. </p><p>In the early exchanges, KKR's seamers hardly offered anything full, Varun and Narine then tightened the screws in the middle overs. Dhoni turned the clock back with some mighty blows at the death to haul CSK to 131 for 5. In the chase, KKR shaved 43 runs off the target in the powerplay without losing a wicket and they eventually eased to victory, despite Bravo's trickery. Do stick with us for the post-match presentation.</p><p><b>Jadeja</b>: I think dew will be vital and it will play a part. If you win the toss, you will definitely look to bowl first. In the first six overs, it was damp and in the second half, the ball was coming on. We were looking to drag the game as deep as we can. Bravo bowled brilliantly and everybody did a good job with the ball. As a batting unit, we didn't get partnerships. We will try to do better next game.</p><p><b>Jackson</b>: The management and staff are brilliant. They're backing me and I'm grateful to them. He [Dhoni] has always been my inspiration - whatever he does I will look to emulate him.</p><p>RajatMaheshwari: ""Well done to Bravo. Deserves to be on the all time wicket taking list at IPL. IPL future hall of famer !!""</p><p>Ashish Nehra: ""Malinga took 170 wickets in 471 overs to Bravo's 490 overs. Both these players are legend.... wait for it.... dary, Legendary. ""</p><p>Tinura: ""Nevertheless, Dhoni scored a fifty, Bravo got 3, and both are now actively became contenders for orange and purple caps respectively. Enough for me (with mad scientist laugh) ""</p><p>Gautam: ""Perfect example of excellent team work by KKR. Dhoni and Bravo were the standout individual performers of the game but CSK were never really into the game""<hr></p>"
